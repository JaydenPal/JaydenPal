### About me

I am a cybersecurity enthusiast trying to devleop my skills in Reverse Engineering,
malware analysis, Digital Forensics / incident response. My skills have been 
devloped via courses at the Univeristy of Texas at San Antonio and CTF settings.

Need someone to look at an executable or binary? Let me know. I've been reading 
so much machine/assembly code lately that I read bytes in my dreams. 


The nerd in me cannot wait to get into the industry and use some fancy, expensive,
tools. Learning about this field at school is fun... but I want to touch the real 
stuff!

With my bachelor's degree finally ending, I am looking to commit time to further 
my studies in cybersecurity. They are not here yet, but I am keen to do some analysis 
on different pieces of malware and DFIR labs. Also with the end of the semester comes 
the ability to upload the work I have done this semesterâ€” after approval from professors. 

AI is here and there is no stopping it! I see a lot of possibilities for the develoment of
tools and systems that are enchanced by neural networks that can help cyber security 
experts perform their jobs easier and with greater assurance of security. I have already 
begun exploring the intersection of data science and cyber security but I am always 
eager to do more.
